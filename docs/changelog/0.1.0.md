### 0.1.0

_Released 2025 Jan 19_

#### Overview

A tiny Kotlin Multiplatform library that provides Base32 en- and decoding
functionality.

This library was developed with the intention to eventually upstream the
functionality into the Standard Library. As such, the API, KDoc, samples, and
tests all closely resemble their `kotlin.io.encoding.Base64` counterparts.
